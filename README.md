# netlify-brooksmt

I use this repo for React experimentation, and netlify testing.

This project also now utilizes Assemblyscript for simple functionality.

## Available Scripts

`npm run dev`: Builds WASM, copies to the public directory and runs development server. Will hot reload to React changes but not AssemblyScript changes.

`npm run wasm-build`: Builds WASM and React for production

`npm run wasm-serve`: Builds WASM, React and serves locally for production testing
